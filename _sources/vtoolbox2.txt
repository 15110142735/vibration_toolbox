The Engineering Vibration Toolbox for `MATLAB`_
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Engineering Vibration Toolbox can be installed by downloading 
`vtbud.m`_ and executing it from within MATLAB. Executing it
later also installs or removes the toolbox. You will get an error if ``vtbud.m`` is not in your
path. If that happens, open ``vtbud.m`` in the MATLAB editor and press the F5 key. This will download
``vtoolbox.zip``, expand it in the desired location, and add the path to it to
your default MATLAB path. Alternatively, copy and
paste this into your MATLAB command console:


.. code-block:: matlab

   » urlwrite('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vibrationtoolbox/vtoolbox/master/vtbud.m','vtbud.m');vtbud

and press RETURN. 

The current revision status of the *Engineering Vibration Toolbox* for
Matlab can
be viewed in the `github
repository <https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/vtoolbox>`_ or more
easily in the `vtbud.txt <https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/vtoolbox/blob/master/vtbud.txt>`_ file on this website.

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list of updates since 1/1/98
can be obtained for your current version by typing ``help vtbud`` in
MATLAB. That can be compared to the `most up-to-date release <https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/vtoolbox/blob/master/vtbud.txt>`__.

They will load/run on all platforms supported by MATLAB. The binary files are all ``.mat`` files, and the different extensions represent different parts of a project group. To load
them type:

.. code-block:: matlab
          
   » load filename -mat

where » is the MATLAB prompt. [#]_ The
filename must include the extension unless it is ``.mat``.

If you can't execute any of the ``.m`` files (try for
example typing "vtbud" from the MATLAB prompt), they
are either not in the MATLAB path, or did not get
transferred in the correct format (unlikely these days). Use the ``cd`` command (like DOS) from
within MATLAB to move to the ``vtoolbox`` directory. If
you can see the files using ``dir``, and still cannot execute them, then try
transferring the text files again, being sure that they are transferred in
ASCII (text) format.

Removing the Engineering Vibration Toolbox:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Type ``vtbud`` from the MATLAB prompt. 


The Engineering Vibration Toolbox for Octave
-------------------------------------------------------
Please read the `Readme.rst
<https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/ovtoolbox/blob/master/Readme.rst>`__
file for information not covered elsewhere. 

Installing, Updating, and Removing The Toolbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install:
********************

1. Run `Octave`_.

2. Copy and paste this into `Octave`_.

.. code-block:: octave

   [s, success, message]=urlwrite('https://github.com/josephcslater/ovtoolbox/archive/master.zip','vtoolbox.zip')
   pkg install vtoolbox.zip
   delete('vtoolbox.zip')
   vtb
   ;

**Note**: If you use the Github Download button, you **must** rename
the downloaded file to :code:`vtoolbox.zip` and manually use :code:`pkg`.

To update:
****************
To update, copy and paste this into `Octave`_

.. code-block:: octave

   pkg uninstall ovtoolbox
   [s, success, message]=urlwrite('https://github.com/josephcslater/ovtoolbox/archive/master.zip','vtoolbox.zip')
   pkg install vtoolbox.zip
   delete('vtoolbox.zip')
   ;
   

To remove:
*****************
In `Octave`_

.. code-block:: octave

   pkg uninstall ovtoolbox
   [s, success, message]=urlwrite('https://github.com/josephcslater/ovtoolbox/archive/master.zip','vtoolbox.zip')
   pkg install vtoolbox.zip
   delete('vtoolbox.zip')
   ;

*Why the semi-colons?* It's my way of maing sure you don't leave the
last command unexecuted.



Printing plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To print a plot, the easiest way may be to type ``print`` from the Octave
console. This should bring up dialog boxes that enable you to send the
current plot to your current Windows printer.

The ``print`` command can also be used to generate graphics files for
embedding into your favorite word processing program. Type ``help print``
for details. By default the file will end up in the directory
``C:\Program Files\GNU Octave #\octave_files`` on Windows.



Acknowledgments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for the Engineering Vibration Toolbox for Octave has come from a number of
sources. First and foremost, Daniel J. Inman, who initially tasked
me and Donald J. Leo to write version 3.0 of the software for his text
"Engineering Vibration" by Dr. Daniel J. Inman (Prentice Hall, 1994). I
also thank the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering and
the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Wright State
University for providing the computer resources for developing the
MATLAB 4 version of the software. Perhaps the people who have given the
most are my students who painfully experienced every piece of beta code,
often at the least opportune times. Thanks is also given to Dr. Maurice
Petyt and Robert C. Chiroux for their patience in testing numerous 4.0
beta versions of this software. Finally, John W. Eaton and others for
writing/coordinating/developing/supporting Octave. Please see the
Octave_ website for more information on Octave and how you can
support its development.

Using the Engineering Vibration Toolbox
=====================================================

Typing ``help vtb?``, where ``?`` is a number, will provide a table of contents for the files
related to chapter '?'. Typing ``help codename`` will provide help on the
particular code. Note  that the ``filename`` is ``codename.m``.

Engineering Vibration Toolbox commands can be run by typing them with
the necessary arguments just as any other Octave/MATLAB
commands/functions. For instance, :code:`vtb1_1` can be run by typing
:code:`vtb1_1(1,.1,1,1,0,10)`. Many functions have multiple forms of input.
The help for each function shows this flexibility.


Faculty/Instructors/GTAs
=========================
Please send comments and questions regarding the Engineering Vibration
Toolbox by email to `Joseph C. Slater`_. Please use the `vtbud.m`_
function to check for updates (Type :code:`vtbud` at the matlab prompt).  

Donate/Payment
===============
The Engineering Vibration Toolbox for MATLAB (not the Octave version,
or any version that runs on a non-proprietary platform) is free only
to owners of Engineering Vibration, Daniel J. Inman. Please contact
`me`_ regarding usage for commercial purposes.
