Description: The Engineering Vibration Toolbox for Python
        =================================================
        
        Joseph C. Slater and Raphael Timbo
        
        This will eventually be the translated Engineering Vibration Toolbox,
        originally written for Matlab, but with extra features only for
        Python. This is an *educational* set of codes intended for
        demonstration. You may find them useful for application, but that
        isn't the intent.
        
        
        Version 0.5b0 install failure
        ------------------------------
        If you attempted to install 0.5b0, you may need to clear the cache first.
        The easy way to do this is to ``pip install --user vibrationtoolbox==0.5b2``.
        
        When a new version is released, use ``pip install --upgrade --user vibrationtoolbox``.
        
        
        Currently:
        
        Type
        
        .. code-block:: shell
        
           jupyter notebook
        
        at your command prompt.
        
        Take a look at ``vtb1_1.ipynb`` and ``vtoolbox Demos.ipynb``, but
        recognize that they are not completely ready to go. Not even close.
        
        However, it gives an idea of where I
        want the project to go.
        
        Sorry for being pithy... this project is a long way off. You're
        welcome to help!
