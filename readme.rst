Joseph C. Slater and Raphael Timbó

Welcome to `Engineering Vibration Toolbox <https://vibrationtoolbox.github.io>`_,
originally written for `Matlab <http://www.mathworks.com>`_\®, but with extra features only for
`Python <http://python.org>`_. This is an *educational* set of codes intended for
demonstration of concepts. You may find them useful for application, but that
isn't the intent. If you have professional level needs, please `contact the authors <mailto:joseph.c.slater@gmail.com>`_.

For more information, please see the `documentation for the Python version <http://vibrationtoolbox.github.io/vibration_toolbox/>`_ but please excuse that it is still under development. Such documentation has never existed for the other ports of the toolbox so this is taking some time. We don't need feedback at this time, but we will take assistance in improving documentation and code. 


Installation
------------
Installation is made easy with ``pip``, with releases as we have time while we try
to create a full first release. Much of it works already, but we certainly need
issue reports (on `github <http://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/vibration_toolbox>`_).

To install::

  pip install --user vibration_toolbox

To run, open a ``jupyter`` notebook and type::

  import vibration_toolbox as vtb

For examples, see the `JupyterNotebooks folder <https://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/vibration_toolbox/tree/master/JupyterNotebooks>`_.
