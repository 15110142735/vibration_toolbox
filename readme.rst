This is the translated `Engineering Vibration Toolbox <https://vibrationtoolbox.github.io>`_,
originally written for `Matlab <http://www.mathworks.com>`_ :supsub:`reg` `reg`, but with extra features only for
Python. This is an *educational* set of codes intended for
demonstration. You may find them useful for application, but that
isn't the intent.

Installation
--------------
Installation is made easy with ``pip``, with releases as we have time while we try
to create a full first release. Much of it works already, but we certainly need
issue reports (on `github <http://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/vibration_toolbox>`_).

To install::

  pip install --user vibration_toolbox

To run, open a ``jupyter`` notebook and type::

  import vibration_toolbox as vt
