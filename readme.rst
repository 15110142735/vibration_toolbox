Thi sis the translated Engineering Vibration Toolbox,
originally written for Matlab, but with extra features only for
Python. This is an *educational* set of codes intended for
demonstration. You may find them useful for application, but that
isn't the intent.

Installation
--------------
Installation is made easy with `pip`, with releases as we have time while we try
to create a full first release. Much of it works already, but we certainly need
issue reports (on `github <http://github.com/vibrationtoolbox/vibration_toolbox>`_).

To install::
  pip install --user vibration_toolbox

To run, open a `jupter` notebook and type::
  import vibration_toolbox as vt
