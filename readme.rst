The Engineering Vibration Toolbox for Python
=================================================


This will eventually be the translated Engineering Vibration Toolbox,
originally written for Matlab, but with extra features only for
Python. This is an *educational* set of codes intended for
demonstration. You may find them useful for application, but that
isn't the intent. 

Currently:

Type

.. code-block:: shell

   ipython notebook

at your command prompt. If you have updated to it, you need to use
:code:`jupyter`.
   
Load and execute the Lorenze example. It's copied from elsewhere, so
I don't deserve any credit there. However, it gives an idea of where I
want the project to go.
